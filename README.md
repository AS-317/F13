Neon SQL Database link: https://console.neon.tech/app/projects/restless-art-74204933?database=neondb

To run: download all the files, open them in a terminal (eg VS code), connect the terminal to the neon SQL database. If using VS Code, install Live Server, click Go Live (at bottom right corner).
Note: the search function doesn't really work, it just brings the user to a default page that shows recipes for carrots & tomatoes.

Parts of this website
1. HTML: HTML is used as the backbone of the website, such as the content to display.
2. CSS: CSS is integrated into the HTML file under <styles>. It is used to give the background and the buttons colour, to switch the colour of the buttons when clicked, and to change the cursor design.
3. JS: JS is used to store the names of the selected food items to run a query in the SQL database (but we're not sure how to connect the code to the database correctly, hence we're unable to execute the JS code in our website)
4. SQL: SQL is used to store the recipes and links for various ingredients.
